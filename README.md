# TicketWizard

This web application was built as an online marketplace for event tickets. The purpose of the site is to provide a one-stop shop for event goers to find upcoming events they might be interested in. Ease of payment is also a priority.

TicketWizardâ€™s goal is to provide the most convenient and fast solution for people looking to purchase tickets for any kind of large event. The website brings together many event hosts and potential customers in a single platform.

## App Features:

* The users can browse through a catalogue of upcoming events (such as concerts, festivals and tournaments), filtered by their location. Each event tuple has a description of the event and all other information a potential buyer could desire. The site design will aggregate many different types of events, and make it easy for customers to find the one they are looking for.
* The users can sign up for a new account with a username and password, as well as their name and email. The users can create events by uploading the details, such as the location, ticket structure, and showings. Accounts can also browse, search for and purchase tickets to events.
* If a customer wants to purchase tickets, a cart is generated which contains the desired event tickets. A cart could contain multiple tickets and is also linked to the event . The customer has stored payment methods. At this time, only credit card payments have been implemented. Cards do not have to be stored on the database after the purchase is complete.
